    <string name="environmentInformation"> Environmental Rating. Producing food has a certain impact
        on the environment. For examples, to create farmland huge forests are cut down, to grow crops
        a lot of fertilizers and pesticides are used, animals are treated with hormones and antibiotics
        which pollute the land and water, create antibiotic resistances and can cause harm in humans,
        water resources are being depleted for irrigation, the fish populations are nearly depleted and
        food production and transportation set free a lot of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n
        The environmental rating includes all these aspects and creates a weighted rating of the environmental
        impact of the dish.\n\n
        In general products from animal origin have a higher environmental impact, because animals require
        more space and water than crops. They also require crops as food and medical treatments. These all
        lead to a lower environmental rating.
